### ‼️ Version Control Conventions (IMPORTANT! Make sure you read this before you contribute!) ‼️
* Create a new branch for every feature you add.
* Push and create a pull request to the ```dev``` branch.
* Do not push directly to ```main```, ```dev``` or ```deploy``` branches!
* Use snake_case for branch names.
* Write descriptive commit messages.
* Explain what you did in a few words in your pull request comment.
* Never merge or close a PR by yourself - one person is solely responsible for handling this to avoid confusion!

### Style Conventions ✍️
You'll see the folder structure and file naming standards, please abide by them.
* Create a folder for the page you're working on in the ```pages``` folder.
* Create ```css```, ```images```, ```js``` files within the appropriate folders.
<h4> Below is a sample of the folder structure: </h4>

```

    |-- icons
    |-- img
    |-- css
    |-- vendor

 |-- pages
     -signup.html
    
```
* Create all JS files in the ```js``` folder

* Images & icons go in the ```images``` & ```icons``` folders respectively.
* Use lowercase letters for file names.
* Use hyphens for naming CSS-classes and IDs, eg ```header-section```. Use readable names.
* For Javascript functions/variables, use the ``` snake_case``` naming convention.
* Please remember to write comments so that others can follow.
